\section{Ethereum and Smart Contracts}
\subsection{Ethereum}
Ethereum is defined as \textit{"an open-source, public, blockchain-based distributed computing platform featuring smart contract (scripting) functionality.  It provides a decentralized Turing-complete virtual machine, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which can execute scripts using an international network of public nodes"} \cite{wiki:xxx}. It has its own programming language called solidity. Ethereum is special because each block in the chain represents a state in a virtual machine. Ethereum is Turing complete meaning it can be programmed to solve any computation problem.
