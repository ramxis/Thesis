\begin{abstract}
In this paper, I explore different blockchain technologies and how they can be exploited for different use case scenarios. I mainly focus on 4 use cases namely Supply Chain Management, Internet of things, File Sharing and Machine to Machine. First, a general introduction of the blockchain is presented. Then, I discuss Ethereum and Smart contracts and what makes it different compared to Bitcoin. I highlight some of the challenges facing blockchains today i.e. the scaling problem, and the transaction finality issue. Then, I look at possible solutions proposed by Ethereum and Bitcoin in order to tackle these problems. A possible extension to one of these solutions in the form of virtual channels and Perun is explored next. Finally, I explore four use case scenarios of blockchains in industry and how it is helping to transform them in each case.
