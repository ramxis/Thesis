\begin{abstract}
Distributed Ledger Technologies like blockchain has emerged as a promising area of research in academia and business. Its tamper resistant nature combined with other properties such as immutability, transparency and byzantine fault tolerance make it particularly useful for applications in Finance, Internet of Things, Supply Chain Management, and Cloud Storage.

In this thesis, I first introduce the basics of blockchain and its related terminologies. Then, I highlight some of challenges faced by this promising new technology along with some potential solutions to those problems. After which, some choice examples of blockchain applications are presented. Next, I focus on the Ethereum blockchain, IPFS and Raiden Network and explore their potential in building powerful new decentralized applications or dApps. 

As part of this thesis, a novel decentralized Supply Chain Management System was designed, implemented and tested. The design was realized using the Ethereum blockchain and was evaluated under various scenarios designed to simulate real world application and usage. This design has several key advantages over traditional systems. It is not only secure against distributed denial of service attacks but is also trustless, autonomous, transparent and censorship resistant.
