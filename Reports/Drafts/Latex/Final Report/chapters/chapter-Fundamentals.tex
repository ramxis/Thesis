\section{Fundamentals - Technology Stacks}
\subsection{Ethereum}\label{eth}
created by vitalik beutarin, a platform for smart contracts
mention different mining algorithm which memory hard and ASIC resistant to prevent mining centralization and monopolies present in bitcoin due to ASICS and large mining pools

\subsubsection{Ethereum virtual machine}
\subsubsection{Merkle Trees in Ethereum}
https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/11/15/merkling-in-ethereum/
there is a difference we use three merkle trees instead of 1 to denote  state in evm, mention reason for it etc.
\subsubsection{Smart Contracts}
Use a figure to exaplain how smart contracts are, i.e. draw a figure/ flowchart like showing signed transaction comming in, smart contract executing it, and triggering events or results or altering state of blockchain. etc
use the figure of smart contract given on the following papers as starting point

\subsubsection{Advantages of smart Contracts}
https://medium.com/@ChainTrade/10-advantages-of-using-smart-contracts-bc29c508691a
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
describe what smart contracts are and what they can do
write about eVM, solidity, and how to communicate with smart contracts from dapps i.e. web3 py3 etc
create a graphical figure showing interaction between smart contract and web3 dapp

\subsection{InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)}
\subsubsection{Cost of Storage on BlockChain}
\subsubsection{Curious Case of Crypto Kitties}
due to sky rocketting transaction costs largely in part of one dapp called crypto kitties the network became congested
