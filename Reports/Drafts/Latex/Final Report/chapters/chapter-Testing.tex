\section{Testing and Results}
problems: events didn't work on infura, so had to change architecture from event based system to request resposne system. Going from synchronous system to asynchronous system caused fundamental redesign of the architecture again. 
\subsection{Testing Environment}
ropsten, pi, ganachi,IPFS
\subsection{Results}
\subsubsection{Unit Testing}
\subsubsection{Scenario - I}
\subsubsection{Scenario - II}
\subsubsection{Scenario - III}
\subsection{Evaluation}
\subsubsection{Gas Consumption}
deployement,each tx cost, word about gas price etc
\subsubsection{Transaction Verification Time}
dependent on gas price, network congestion etc
