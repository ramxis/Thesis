Distributed Ledger Technologies like blockchain has emerged as a promising area of research in academia and business. Its tamper resistant nature combined with other properties such as immutability, transparency and byzantine fault tolerance make it particularly interesting for applications in Finance, Internet of Things, Supply Chain Management, and Cloud Storage.

In this thesis, we first introduce the basics of blockchain and its related terminologies. Then, we highlight some of challenges faced by this promising new technology along with some potential solutions to those problems. After which, some choice examples of blockchain applications are presented. Next, we focus on the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem and explore its potential in building a new decentralized system for Supply Chain Management and Shipment Tracking.
 
The main contribution of this thesis is a novel decentralized Supply Chain Management System. The design of this system is realized using the Ethereum blockchain and was evaluated under various scenarios designed to simulate real world application and usage. Its design has several key advantages over traditional systems. It is secure against distributed denial of service attacks (DDOS) and has additional advantages of being trust less, autonomous, transparent and censorship resistant.
